The Amazon Web Services (AWS) console is a web application that provides access for users to manage and utilize various AWS services. The console serves as an interface that lets users launch instances, provision resources, and work with Amazon S3 buckets. AWS console access can be granted via web browser or mobile app, and users will need to have an AWS account and login credentials to use it.
